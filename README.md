## HEAT Automator Workflows

These workflows install a Service (or Quick Action) which accepts text from any application and attempts to pull out an 8-digit Oxford HEAT incident/task/change/service request number. Then it will either be used to open Oxford HEAT directly to the item or copy the item's URL to the clipboard so it can be pasted elsewhere.

To use:

0. Clone this repo or download a [release](https://github.com/fuzzylogiq/OpenInHEAT/releases/latest) and untar/unzip.
0. Double click on the workflow to install it.
0. Select text in almost any application and then control (or two finger on a touchpad) click the selected text and choose Services > (Open in HEAT/Copy HEAT URL)
0. If you want you can assign a key combination to the Service in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts

These workflows are provided without support, use at your own discretion. Tested on 10.14 Mojave only.
