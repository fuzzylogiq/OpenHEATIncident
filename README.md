## Open in HEAT Automator Workflow

This workflow installs a Service (or Quick Action) which accepts text from any application and attempts to pull out an 8-digit Oxford HEAT incident/task/change/service request number which will then be used to open Oxford HEAT directly to that page.

To use:

0. Clone this repo or download a [release](https://github.com/fuzzylogiq/OpenHEATIncident/releases/latest) and untar/unzip.
0. Double click on the workflow to install it.
0. Select text in almost any application and then control (or two finger on a touchpad) click the selected text and choose Services > Open in HEAT
0. If you want you can assign a key combination to the Service in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts

This workflow is provided without support. Tested on 10.14 Mojave only.
