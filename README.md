## Open Heat Incident Automator Workflow

This workflow installs a Service (or Quick Action) which accepts text from any application and attempts to pull out an 8-digit Oxford HEAT incident number which will then be used to open Oxford HEAT directly to that incident.

To use:

0. Clone this repo or download a release and untar/unzip.
0. Double click on the workflow to install it.
0. Select text in almost any application and then control (or two finger on a touchpad) click the selected text and choose Services > Open HEAT Incident
0. If you want you can assign a key combination to the Service in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts

This workflow is provided without support. Tested on 10.14 Mojave only.
